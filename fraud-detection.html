    <h2 id="h2i"> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            Let’s suppose you look at the latest census for wherever you live, and you count the frequencies of each leading digit (1 – 9) for its population. You would expect the count to be all roughly equal, that they would each occur about 1/9 or 11% of the time, no?

            WRONG.

            That is the principle behind Benford’s Law. It states that 1 occurs as the leading digit of a number around 30% of the time, whereas 9 appears only around 5% of the time. 

            In particular, it gives the probability $P(d)$ that a randomly chosen number starts with the leading digit $d$ where $d \in \{1, 2 \ldots 9 \}$. 
        </p>

        <div class="equations">
            $P(d)=log_{10}(d+1)-log_{10}(d)=log_{10}(\frac{d+1}{d})=log_{10}(1+\frac{1}{d})$<br>

    <h2 id="h2ii"> Mathematics </h2>
    
        <p>
            A number $x$ has a leading digit $d$ if and only if $log_{10}(d) \leqslant \{ log_{10}(x) \} &lt; log_{10}(d+1)$ <br>
            <strong>Note: </strong> The curly braces {} denote the <strong>fractional part,</strong> or $frac(x) = x-\lfloor x \rfloor$, which essentially returns just the fractional part of $x$, hence the name.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, for the number $x=231$, the leading digit $d=2$ because <br>
            $log_{10}(2) \leqslant \{ log_{10}(231) \} &lt; log_{10}(3)$ <br>
            $0.3 \leqslant 0.36 &lt; 0.48$
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, $\{log_{10}(x)\}$ lies in an interval of length $log_{10}(d+1)-log_{10}(d)$, or <br>            
            $P(d)=log_{10}(d+1)-log_{10}(d)=log_{10}(\frac{d+1}{d})=log_{10}(1+\frac{1}{d})$<br>
        </p>
    
        <h3 id="h3i"> Generalisation to Different Base Systems </h3>
            <p>
                So far, we have been working with the decimal system, and thus our logarithm is in base 10. In fact, Benford’s law can be generalised to other bases $b$, where: <br>
                $P(d)=log_{b}(1+\frac{1}{d})$ <br>
                
                For example, in the hexadecimal base $b = 16$, 
            </p>
                <ul>   
                    <li>1 occurs $log_{16}(1+\frac{1}{1})$ ≈ 25% of the time, </li>
                    <li>F (hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal number 15) occurs $log_{16}(1+\frac{1}{15})$ ≈ 2.23% of the time.</li>
                </ul>
    
        <h3 id="h3ii"> Generalisation to Digits Beyond the First </h3>
            <p>
                In fact, $log_{10}(1+\frac{1}{d})$ gives not only the probability of a decimal number starting with the leading digit $n$, but the probability of a number starting with the <em> string of $n$ digits.</em>
            </p>
            <h4> First n Digits Test</h4>
                <p>
                    For example, the probability of a number starting with 12... is $log_{10}(1+\frac{1}{12})$ ≈3.5%.
                    Likewise, the probability of a number starting with 999 is $log_{10}(1+\frac{1}{999})$ ≈ 0.00043%. 
                </p>
            <h4> Second Digit Test</h4>
                <p>
                    Further, the above result can be extended to give the probability that a particular number occurs at the second digit.
                    For example, the probability that a 4 appears in the second digit is given by: <br>
                    $log_{10}(1+\frac{1}{14}) + log_{10}(1+\frac{1}{24}) + ... + log_{10}(1+\frac{1}{94})$ ≈ 10.03%.
                </p>
            <h4> nth Digit Test</h4>
                <img src="images/fraud-detection/nthDigitTest.png" class="articleImage">

    <h2 id="h2iii"> Applications </h2>
    
        <p> Some distributions that may not follow the Benford distribution are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sequentially assigned numbers (e.g. check numbers, invoice numbers, etc) </li>
            <li>Number influenced by human thought (e.g. prices set by psychological tricks, like $1.99 instead of 2)</li>
            <li>Accounts with a built-in minimum or maximum limit (e.g. a maximum of $10000 can be withdrawn at a time)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Numbers that represent magnitudes of events, such as populations of cities, flows of water in rivers or sizes of celestial bodies, usually follow the Benford distribution.</p>
    
        <h3 id="h3iii"> Fraudulent Data </h3>
            <p> 
                Since humans tend to think in <strong> Uniform, </strong> or at best, <strong> Normal Distribution</strong>, it is difficult to manually construct distributions that satisfy Benford’s law. Even if they consciously manipulate the first digits of their data, in practice, the generalised form of the law above is used to check for multiple digits and hence increase precision. Therefore, scientists can identify fraudulent numerical data sets by checking to see if it agrees with Benford’s law.
            </p>
    
            <h4> Fraudulent Greek Government Data </h4>
            <p>
                In 2011, scientists analysed 130 different values from 11 years’ worth of official macroeconomic data that EU Member States reported to Eurostat, including total debt, government cash reserves and pensions of retired civil servants. From Benford’s law, they found that that the Greek government’s data deviated significantly from the Benford distribution, particularly in the year 2000 – one year before Greece officially joined the EU. This suggests that the government manipulated their data, and that had Benford’s law been used at the time, the Greek government may not have been able to enter the EU. Economists say that this simple law could have prevented the current Greek economic crisis.
            </p>
    
            <h4> Where else can it be used? </h4>
            <p>
                Electricity bills, loan data, street addresses, election results, stock prices, purchase orders, house prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, research data (e.g. regression models), credit card transactions, areas of countries, the sky is the limit!

            <p> In addition, the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 3, 5, 8…), the factorials (1!, 2!, 3!, 4!... = 1, 2, 6, 24…) as well as almost the powers of any number obey the law. Square roots and reciprocals disobey the law. </p>

    <h2 id="h2iv"> Did You Know? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1938, Frank Benford, a research physicist and the law’s namesake, collected more than 20,000 numbers from 20 sources and showed that they all satisfied the law. </li>
            <li>The first person to notice the law was not Frank Benford, but American astronomer Simon Newcomb in 1881 after he noticed that the book of logarithm tables was much more worn out at pages beginning with a 1 or 2 (e.g. page 14, 100, 2, 297, etc.)</li>
            <li>Benford’s law is <strong> scale invariant:</strong> it applies even if the units are changed, such as centimetres, metres or kilometres.</li>
            <li>To confirm that the Benford probabilities do indeed sum to 100%, check that the sum of the probabilities for each individual digit is a <strong> telescoping series,</strong> which, as expected, yields 1.
